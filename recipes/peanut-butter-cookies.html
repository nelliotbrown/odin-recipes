            Ingredients:
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1 cup crunchy peanut butter</li>
                <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li> ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt
                </li>
            </ul>
            Steps:
            <ol>
                <li>Beat butter, peanut butter, white sugar, and brown sugar with 
                    an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth; beat in eggs.</li>

                <li>Sift flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into a separate bowl; 
                    stir into butter mixture until dough is just combined. Chill cookie dough in the refrigerator 
                    for 1 hour to make it easier to work with. </li>     

                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>  

                <li>Roll dough into 1-inch balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
                    Flatten each ball with a fork, making a crisscross pattern. </li>

                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 7 to 10 minutes. 
                    Cool on the baking sheets briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>  
            </ol>
